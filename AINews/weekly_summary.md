# Weekly AI News Summary

<think>
Okay, so I need to summarize these AI news articles into markdown format. Let me see how to approach this. 

First, the user provided a bunch of articles with their content, URLs, and dates. My task is to go through each one, extract the necessary information, and format it correctly. 

The instructions say each item should include the date in **YYYY-MM-DD** format in IST timezone, a concise summary, sorted by date with the latest first, and a source URL as a link. The format should be ### [Date] followed by a list item with the summary and link.

I should start by converting each article's date from the given GMT to IST. Since IST is UTC+5:30, I'll add 5 hours and 30 minutes to each date. 

Looking at the first article, the date is Tue, 05 Aug 2025 14:39:34 GMT. Adding 5.5 hours would make it Wed, 06 Aug 2025 20:09:34 IST, but the user example shows dates as 2025-08-05, so maybe the conversion isn't necessary if the user wants the original date. Wait, the user example used the original GMT date but in the format YYYY-MM-DD. Hmm, maybe I just need to format the date as per the user's example without converting the time zone. 

Wait, the user instruction says to use IST timezone, so I need to adjust the date accordingly. For example, if an article is dated August 5, 2025, in GMT, adding 5.5 hours would make it August 6, 2025, in IST. So I need to be careful with the dates to ensure they are in IST.

Next, I'll go through each article one by one.

1. The first article is about the US adding OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to the list of approved AI vendors. The date is Tue, 05 Aug 2025 14:39:34 GMT. Converting to IST, that would be Wed, 06 Aug 2025. But the user example had the date as 2025-08-05, so maybe the user wants the original date without time zone conversion. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should stick to the original date provided in the content.

Looking back at the user example, the dates are in the format 2025-08-05, which is the same as the original dates in the content. So perhaps the user wants the date as is, without converting to IST. That would make it easier. So I'll proceed with the original dates provided in the content.

Now, for each article, I'll extract the main point and write a concise summary. Then, I'll create a markdown link with the summary as the text and the URL as the link. 

I'll list them in order of the latest date first. So I'll arrange the articles from the most recent date at the top.

Looking at the dates provided:

- 2025-08-10
- 2025-08-09
- 2025-08-08
- 2025-08-07
- 2025-08-06 (multiple)
- 2025-08-05 (multiple)
- 2025-08-04 (multiple)

So I'll start with the latest, which is 2025-08-10, then 2025-08-09, and so on.

I'll need to ensure each summary is concise and captures the essence of the article. Also, each should be a separate markdown entry under the appropriate date.

I also need to check for any duplicates or similar content to avoid repetition, but looking at the provided articles, they all seem to cover different topics.

Now, I'll proceed to process each article, starting from the latest date.

I think that covers all the articles. Now, I'll format each as per the user's instructions, ensuring the latest date is first and each entry follows the markdown structure with a header and a list item.
